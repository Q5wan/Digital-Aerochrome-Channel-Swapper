# Digital-Aerochrome-Channel-Swapper
A Python program that uses the pillow library to manipulate a digital infrared photo taken with a yellow filter and swaps the channels to replicate Kodak Aerochrome film. **NOTE: THIS PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO WORK WITH IMAGES TAKEN ON A DIGITAL SENSOR, WITH THE IR CUT FILTER REMOVED AND A YELLOW 12/15 FILTER**
You will have to modify the parameters for another color infrared imagery, plus the images might have a color cast depending on the sensor/lighting, etc.

# Instructions
Download the Python program and edit TEST1.JPG to the infrared image. Then change the save location to wherever you want and run the code.
